# the-super-tiny-compiler-ts

This is a (still incomplete) TypeScript adaptation of The Super Tiny Compiler.

## TODO
* Add tests.
* Go through Code Generator and remove disabled linting rules and type correctly. You'll need to add a number of optional properties to the ASTNote type, or create a NewASTNode type.

***Welcome to The Super Tiny Compiler!***

This is an ultra-simplified example of all the major pieces of a modern compiler
written in easy to read ~~JavaScript~~ TypeScript.

Reading through the guided code will help you learn about how *most* compilers
work from end to end.
